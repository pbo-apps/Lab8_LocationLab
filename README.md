Lab project from week 4 of Adam Porter's Coursera course, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2
https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming-2/home/welcome

Lab Objectives:
This weekâ€™s Lab will help you learn how to use location information in your Android applications.
Upon completion of this lab, you should have a better understanding of how to listen for and respond to
Location measurements.
This application displays a ListView containing a set of Place Badges. Each Place Badge contains a
country flag, a country name, and a place name corresponding to the user's location when the Place
Badge was acquired. The Footer for the ListView displays the words "Get New Place." When the user
clicks on the Footer, the application will attempt to capture a new Place Badge based on the user's
current location.
